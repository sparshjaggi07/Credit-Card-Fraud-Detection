# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It is a Streamlit application designed for credit card fraud detection. It incorporates various functionalities to facilitate data exploration, feature selection, and model training and evaluation.

Key Features:

**Data Loading and Exploration**: The code allows users to load a CSV file containing credit card transaction data. It provides options to view the dataframe, its description, and details about fraudulent and valid transactions.
**Feature Selection**: It employs feature importance techniques to identify the most relevant features for fraud detection. Users can choose between Extra Trees Classifier and Random Forest Classifier for feature selection. The selected features are then used for model training.
**Model Training and Evaluation**: The code offers a range of classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Extra Trees) for fraud detection. It also addresses the class imbalance issue by providing options for imbalanced class rectification (SMOTE, Near Miss). The performance of the chosen model and rectifier is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive framework for credit card fraud detection, enabling users to explore data, select features, and experiment with different models and imbalanced class handling techniques.
